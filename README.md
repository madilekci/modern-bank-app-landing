# modern-bank-app-landing


In this project you'll see how I utilized my full stack web development skills to create a sleek and modern landing page for an imaginary Hoobank App. 
This page was built using a variety of cutting-edge technologies, including React.js and Tailwind CSS.

I paid close attention to every detail to ensure that the final product matched the original design in Figma pixel-perfectly.
From responsive design to seamless functionality, this landing page is a testament to my commitment to excellence and attention to detail.
